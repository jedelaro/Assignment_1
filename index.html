		<p> My name is Jesus De La Rosa, and this is my webpage. I want people who visit this site to know a little bit about me. <br>
		I am a junior at Arizona State University majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am also a Barrett Honors Student. I was <br>
		an alto saxophone player in the Sun Devil Marching Band my freshman year. I am a member of many engineering clubs, <br>
		most notably SHPE and MAES. </p>
		<br>
		<p> My interests include sports, music, exercise, volunteering, playing video games, and watching TV shows. I have a dog <br>
		named Pawz who I've had for 12 years, who is also the best dog any person can ask for. I have a sister that is 14 years <br>
		older than me. I have a niece who claims I am her best friend. I have a girlfriend who also goes to ASU (we were friends <br>
		since high school). She is majoring in Finance and and has a perfect GPA (So Proud). </p>
		<br>
		<p> Well, this was just a little bit that I wanted to share with you and I hope this helped you know a little bit more about who <br>
		I am and what I do. </p>
